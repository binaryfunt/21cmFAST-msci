**************  To Install **********************
1) You must have fftw installed (with the float compilation)
before compiling these files.  Download and unpack fftw:
http://www.fftw.org/download.html

then install:

   `./configure --enable-float  --enable-openmp`
   `make`
   `sudo make install`

   or if you are installing on a shared machine and/or don't have root priviledges:

   `./configure --enable-float  --enable-openmp --prefix=NAME_OF_LOCAL_DIRECTORY`
   `make`
   `make install`

   (note in this case, you have to add the include/ and lib/ directories to the 
   compiler path with the -I compiler flag in the makefile)

2) Install (if not already installed) the gnu scientific library (GSL).
   http://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/

3) cd to the `Programs` directory and set the desired compiler flag 
   in the makefile, as well as the paths, if the above installations
   went to non-standard directories.

4) Type `make` to compile code


**************  To Run **********************
Set your desired simulation and cosmology parameters in the .H files in the 
`Parameter_files` directory.

Then you can run the analysis programs either
individually or through the driver programs
(see PROGRAM_LIST in `Programs`)

NOTE: you only need to run 'init' once for each realization,
so comment out the command in the driver files, if using
them again on the same realization.

**************  NOTES  ***************************
THE MEMORY USE OF THE FULL CODE IS APPROXIMATELY
((DIM^3 + 4*HII_DIM^3) * 4 ) / 1E9  GB
MAKE SURE YOU HAVE ENOUGH RAM!
The default settings use ~2.2GB
